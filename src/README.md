# Introduction

Welcome to the Brevis ProverNet, the foundational coordination layer for the ZK ecosystem. ProverNet operates as a **decentralized marketplace** that bridges the gap between applications requiring zero-knowledge proofs and the specialized hardware capable of generating them

#### Coordinating the ZK Ecosystem

As the demand for verifiable computation and trustless applications scales, the need for high-performance, cost-effective ZK proving capacity is growing rapidly. ProverNet addresses this by creating a unified environment where all participants—from developers to hardware providers—interact to drive the efficiency of zero-knowledge technology.

* **ZK App Developers**: Focus entirely on building innovative application logic without the burden of managing complex proving infrastructure. By defining computational work for the **Pico zkVM**, developers gain instant access to a global network of hardware.
* **ZK App Users**: Benefit from lower costs and faster response times for verifiable transactions. Real-time competition between provers ensures that efficiency gains are passed directly to users via optimized proof fees.
* **Provers**: Hardware providers find a streamlined way to monetize their capacity. The network’s auction mechanism matches provers with the specific workloads that best suit their hardware optimizations.
* **Stakers**: Token holders provide the economic security that underpins every proof. By delegating BREV to reputable provers, stakers help ensure a high quality of service while participating in the growth of the proving economy.

#### The BREV Economy

The **BREV token** serves as the heartbeat of the ProverNet economy, aligning incentives and facilitating value exchange across the network:

* **Payment Medium**: BREV is the native settlement currency for all proving services.
* **Economic Security**: Provers and delegators stake BREV to guarantee network reliability. This collateral ensures that prover nodes remain committed to delivering valid proofs within requested deadlines.
* **Reward Distribution**: Staked BREV qualifies participants to receive a share of the network's generated proof fees and rewards, incentivizing long-term support and high-quality service.
* **Network Governance**: BREV holders govern critical protocol parameters, such as marketplace fee structures and minimum security requirements.
