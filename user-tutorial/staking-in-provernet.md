# Staking in ProverNet

BREV holders may stake BREV to the provers in ProverNet. The process of staking is a form of active participation similar to proof of stake delegation. With these delegated BREV, a prover can therefore receive more proving workload by locking them up and earn additional revenue. In return, the prover will share a portion of the proving fees with the delegators.

#### Bridge BREV to Base

ProverNet allows you staking BREV on Base. Before you start staking, you may need to bridge BREV to Base first, via [cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/8453/BREV).

#### View Active Provers

Note that if the delegated prover fails to meet its SLA commitments, your delegated stake may be slashed. Therefore, it is critical to carefully evaluate different proving providers and adjust\
your stakes from time to time. Visit Brevis Prover Network _\[Link]_ and you can view all active provers in the ProverNet, along with key statistics such as the number of BREV staked, the number of proofs generated, and the proof fee received.

#### Stake BREV

To start staking your BREV, you will need to connect wallet and select the prover you would like to stake with.&#x20;

Once wallet is connected, the _Stake_ button will be enabled and you can click the button to stake now!

You may need to _Approve_ the Brevis staking contract first to allow it to spend your BREV. Once sufficient amount is approved, the _Stake_ button will be enabled, and you can submit the stake transaction.

You can also increase your stake with provers you’ve already delegated to. Visit the _Dashboard_ _\[Link]_ to see your current delegated provers and use the _Stake More_ option to add additional BREV.

#### Dashboard

On the Dashboard _\[LINK]_, you can view your total stake and see detailed staking information for each prover, including the staked amount, the pending unstake amount, and the withdrawable amount.

* **Your total stake**: includes all your staked BREV to each prover plus the staking rewards you've earned. The staking rewards are automatically compounded into your total stake on a daily basis.
* **Staked amount for each prover**: is the total amount of BREV you currently staked with this prover.
* **Pending unstake amount**: is the unstaked amount pending in the unstaking process, which takes 7 days to complete.
* **Withdrawable amount**: is the unstaked amount with this prover that has passed the 7-day processing window and is now withdrawable.

#### Unstake BREV

You can unstake your BREV at any time by clicking the _Request Unstake_ button on the Dashboard page.&#x20;

First, you may need to _Approve_ the Brevis staking contract to allow it to unstake your BREV. Once sufficient amount is approved, the _Unstake_ button will be enabled, and you can submit the unstake transaction. Please note that the unstaking process takes **7 days**. After the waiting period, you can withdraw your BREV and have them returned to your account.

#### Withdraw BREV

You can withdraw your unstaked BREV once the 7-day processing window has passed, by simply clicking the _Withdraw_ button on the Dashboard page. If you have no unstaked BREV or your unstaked BREV is still within the 7-day waiting period, the _Withdraw_ button will be disabled.
