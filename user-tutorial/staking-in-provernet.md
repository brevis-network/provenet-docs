# Staking in ProverNet

BREV holders can stake and delegate tokens to provers on ProverNet. Delegation works similarly to proof-of-stake systems: provers with more delegated stake can take on more proving jobs, and in return they share a portion of the proving fees with their delegators.

#### Bridge BREV to Base

ProverNet staking currently operates on Base. Before you start staking, you may need to bridge BREV to Base using [cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/8453/BREV).

#### View Active Provers

If a prover fails to meet its SLA commitments, delegated stake may be slashed. Evaluate provers carefully and adjust your delegation periodically.&#x20;

Visit the [Brevis Prover Network](https://provernet.brevis.network/) to view all active provers along with key statistics including BREV staked, proofs generated, and fees earned.

#### Stake BREV

To stake, connect your wallet and select a prover.&#x20;

You may need to _Approve_ the Brevis staking contract to allow the spending of BREV first. Once approved, you can submit the stake transaction.

#### Dashboard

The _Dashboard_ tab displays your total stake and detailed information for each prover, including staked amount, pending unstake amount, and withdrawable amount.

* **Your Total Stake**: All BREV staked across provers plus earned rewards. Rewards compound automatically on a daily basis.
* **Staked Amount**: BREV currently staked with a specific prover.
* **Pending Unstake Amount**: Amount currently in the 7-day unstaking period.
* **Withdrawable Amount**: Unstaked amount that has passed the 7-day period and is ready to withdraw.

#### Unstake BREV

You can unstake BREV at any time by clicking the _Request Unstake_ button on the Dashboard page.&#x20;

You may need to _Approve_ the Brevis staking contract first. Once approved, submit the unstake transaction. The unstaking period is **7 days**. After the waiting period, you can withdraw your BREV.

#### Withdraw BREV

Once the 7-day period has passed, click the _Withdraw_ button on the Dashboard page to return your BREV to your wallet. The _Withdraw_ button remains disabled if you have no unstaked BREV, or until the waiting period is complete.
